# Static Testing

There are two types of testing techniques which are further divided among sub categories. The two main categories are as follows:

1. Static Testing
2. Dynamic testing

**Definition:**

Static testing is a software testing method that examines a program -- along with any associated documents -- but does not require the program to be executed. Dynamic testing, the other main category of software testing, requires testers to interact with the program while it runs.

**Explanation:**

Static testng is done when there is no need to run the code and we only edit the file or proof read it to remove any kind of errors such as syntax errors, unused libraries, unused variables, uninitialized variables etc.
