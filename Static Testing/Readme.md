# Static Testing

There are two types of testing techniques which are further divided among sub categories. The two main categories are as follows:

    Static Testing
    Dynamic testing

**Definition:**

Static testing is a software testing method that examines a program -- along with any associated documents -- but does not require the program to be executed. Dynamic testing, the other main category of software testing, requires testers to interact with the program while it runs.

**Explanation:**

Static testng is done when there is no need to run the code and we only edit the file or proof read it to remove any kind of errors such as syntax errors, unused libraries, unused variables, uninitialized variables etc.

## Library

### Library used: Flake8

**Details:**

Flake8 is a linter tool for Python code that helps developers identify and fix issues related to code quality and style. It combines several other popular linter tools, including PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and McCabe, to provide a comprehensive set of checks that help ensure that your Python code is correct, readable, and maintainable.

Flake8 checks for a wide range of issues, including:

    Syntax errors and undefined names
    Unused imports and variables
    Unnecessary parentheses and whitespace
    Long lines and too many statements per line
    Complexity and cyclomatic complexity
    Poorly formatted docstrings

By running Flake8 on your Python code, you can quickly identify potential issues and improve the overall quality of your codebase. Flake8 can be integrated into a variety of development workflows, including continuous integration and code review processes, to ensure that code quality remains high throughout the development cycle.
